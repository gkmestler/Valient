          <p>
            Unlike other firms, we use a long-term, buy-and-build approach focused on continuously improving businesses over time rather than flipping them. We work closely with existing teams, and keep what already works while modernizing the business to stay competitive in today's market. We protect the owner's legacy and drive new growth through technology and operational excellence.
